# Blocks for RubyMotion

A simple puzzle game built using RubyMotion and cocos2D for iPhone.

The game concept is based on [MobiGame](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobigame/id548210182?ls=1&mt=8).

## Why?

I just want to experiment and learn using RubyMotion + cocos2d to create iPhone game.

## Tools and Credits

This app is built using:

- Mac OSX 10.8
- XCode 4.4
- RubyMotion 1.20
- Cocos2d for iPhone (2.1 development branch, because of [this issue](https://github.com/scottymac/cocosmotion/pull/1))
